//Task 1

// SELECT table1.varsToDisplay, table1.varsToDisplay2, etc
// FROM table1 
// INNER JOIN table2
// ON table1.varToUnite = table2.otherVarToUnite;

//Key words
>>INNER JOIN
>>LEFT OUTER JOIN (nulls on right)
>>RIGHT OUTER JOIN (nulls on left)

Q1.
//Inner join is best here since we're only interested in actors in starring roles

SELECT p.star,  p.moviename, p.date
FROM Actor AS a INNER JOIN Performs AS p
ON a.actorname = p.star;

Q2.
// Outer left joins as we want all poperties to be displaye but not all offers
SELECT p.address, p.type, o.date
FROM Property AS p 
OUTER LEFT JOIN Offers AS o
ON p.address = o.address;

Q3.
// Outer left joins as we want all cruises to be but only rating from ships
SELECT c.origin, c.destination, c.cost, s.rating
FROM Cruises AS c 
OUTER LEFT JOIN Ships AS s
ON c.shipname = s.shipname;
